Less than a month ago I created a repository for the first time with the help of my friend, Josh. There I tried to find something that I could be passionate about, something that I could craft as I hone in on what it really is that drives me.

I think that I have found that something...

As the second repository that I am creating, this will serve as my "Current" project because it is not my first repository and nor shall it be my last. I find the concept of nurturing an idea or an envisioned creation to be an awesome experience and thus, I am attempting to do the very same here in a medium that is admittedly unfamiliar to me. That medium is Coding.

In the coming days I plan to build upon that idea, to begin to bring this vision to life. Thoughtfully I will attempt to piece together some of the many things that are going on in my head.
